# Concluding Findings
The findings in the analysis suggest multiple implications. Fundamentally, our perceptions of the cause of why another person performs better than us is important in influencing envy. 

We may be more likely to engage in harmful action that stems from malicious envy when we attribute the cause of our inferior performance when a compared individual has an advantage is due to bad luck or unfairness. Finally, that those who are effortful in performing well may be slightly more likely to be envious of someone they compare themselves to that has some type of advantage over them. 

To replicate more concrete and conclusive findings, more data is necessary. Additionally, the data generated must be from a study where participants are incentivized to perform well. Otherwise, envy may not be successfully stimulated. In this study, it is not clear whether envy is stimulated. Therefore, the choices made by participants following an upward comparison may not have be a direct result of envy and rather an act of anger, revenge, or economic invcentive.  Provision of additional or better incentives to perform well may assist in stimulating envy, though that is difficult with limited resources.
