# Concluding Findings
The findings in the analysis suggest multiple implications. Fundamentally, our perceptions of the cause of why another person performs better than us is important in influencing envy. 
We may be more likely to engage in harmful action that stems from malicious envy when we attribute the cause of our inferior performance when a compared individual has an advantage is due to bad luck or differences in intelligence. 
Finally, that those who are effortful in performing well are slightly more likely to act maliciously when they are envious of someone they compare themselves to that has some type of advantage over them. 

To replicate more concrete and conclusive findings, more data is necessary. 
Additionally, the data generated must be from a study where participants are incentivized to perform well. Otherwise, envy may not be successfully stimulated. In this study, it is not clear whether envy is stimulated. Provision of additional or better incentives to perform well may assist in stimulating envy, though that is difficult with limited resources.
