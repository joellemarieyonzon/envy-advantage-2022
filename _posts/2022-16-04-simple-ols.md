# Simple OLS models
For analysis, an initial simple OLS regression model was run for all three datasets that took advantage as the sole determinant of envy-motivated action. 
The best performing model was created with the 2-point difference data at 0.008 r-squared, while the model created with the combined data exhibited almost no explanatory power with no consistency in sign. 
The models for the 2-point and combined data show a positively signed coefficient, meaning that when one perceives an opponent as having an advantage, they are more likely to exhibit envy-motivated malicious behavior.  
In all models, advantage held no statistical significance at even the 0.10 significance level. 
Additionally, Breusch-Pagan testing showed no homoskedasticity in the models.
