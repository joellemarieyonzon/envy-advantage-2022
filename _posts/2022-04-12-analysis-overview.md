## Analysis Overview
The data and methodology used in the analysis aims to be exploratory in tandem with an attempt to uncover a causal relationship between envy and a perceived advantage. 
The analysis serves to determine whether observing an advantage when performing an upward comparison has a causal effect on the type of envy experienced by an individual. 
This analysis was performed with data where the differences between individuals in the upward comparison was both large (seemingly unattainable) and small (seemingly attainable).
