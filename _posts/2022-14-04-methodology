# Methodology

Due to the meager number of observations, a power analysis was performed to find the magnitude of effect possible with the given data. 
To explore whether a causal relationship exists between envy and a perceived advantage, a basic ordinary least squares model was utilized to estimate the coefficients of linear regression due to the controlled nature of the study. 
It is possible to use matching or synthetic controls, but they are not needed because of the implementation of controls already in the experiment performed to generate the data.

The OLS model asserts 6 assumptions to derive estimators:
1.	The model is linear in parameters.
2.	There is a random sampling of observations.
3.	The conditional mean should be zero.
4.	There is no multi-collinearity.
5.	There is no homoskedasticity or autocorrelation.
6.	Error terms are normally distributed.

The OLS model will be a Linear Probability Model that to determine how perceiving an advantage in who individual compares themselves to another affects the likelihood to act in accordance with benign or malicious envy, so it is acceptable to assume linearity. 
We can rely on the economic theory that OLS is the BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) since the trial is randomized. This will result in the smallest normally distributed standard errors, a conditional mean of zero, and the most accurate estimators. 
Correlation matrices show no signs of collinearity between variables of interest for the model. Breusch-Pagan testing will be performed to test for homoskedasticity.

The regression was followed by a difference-in-means analysis to test for statistically significant differences between variables between conditions. 
These methods of analysis were performed separately for the 2-point and 5-point difference data as well as the combined data to explore any effect.
