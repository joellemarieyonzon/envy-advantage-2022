# There are actually two types of envy.
Envy is a common and culturally universal experience. We all experience envy, and we act upon it. Modern research on envy revealed that envy is not one-dimensional and there exists a benign type of envy, which results in upward motivation. Envy can come in two forms: benign envy and malicious envy. Benign envy is related to the motivation to move up and increases motivation to invest more effort to improve one’s own position. It lacks ill will. Malicious envy is related to pulling superior other down and increases the motivation to harm an envied person’s success. 

# Why envy?
Envy is a significant motivator for behavior when we act on it. College students study harder to earn higher grades after comparing themselves to their better colleagues. However, college students also sabotage peers who earn higher grades by doing things such as ripping relevant pages from shared textbooks or spreading false information. Many opportunities exist for man to choose either better themselves or sabotage others.

# What am I interested in?
The goal of this project is to see if perceived advantages affect the type of envy elicited. The primary question to be answered is: “Do perceived advantages influence the type of elicited envy?” If possible, I’d like to also analyze whether there are demographic differences in types of envy experienced by some type of people. I am also interested in if the perceptions of our own skills influence the type of elicited envy.
